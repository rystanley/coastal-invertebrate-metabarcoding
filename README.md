**Abstract**

Eelgrass (*Zostera marina*) meadows are a common feature of Atlantic coastlines, forming productive marine communities that are valued for their ecosystem services. Long-term adaptive management of these sensitive ecosystems and effective conservation of the biodiversity they support requires tools to evaluate and monitor patterns of diversity. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a non-invasive and cost-effective approach for estimating aquatic biodiversity, with significant potential for broad-scale monitoring of complex habitats like seagrass communities. In this study, we utilized eDNA metabarcoding to characterize invertebrate biodiversity in eelgrass meadows along a latitudinal gradient in the Northwest Atlantic and compared results to historical surveys of eelgrass in the region. Across 17 sites, 138 metazoan invertebrate taxa were detected with a taxonomic probability assignment >95%. eDNA was successful at capturing regional patterns of community structure and detecting 20 of 26 common invertebrate taxa based on published records, as well as 80 species not historically recorded. These results emphasize the potential of eDNA to augment eelgrass ecosystem monitoring by enabling efficient, non-invasive cataloguing of biodiversity, including cryptic species that evade conventional sampling.
